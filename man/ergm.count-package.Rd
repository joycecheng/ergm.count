Fit, Simulate and Diagnose Exponential-Family Models for Networks with
Count Edges 
}
\description{
\code{\link[=ergm.count-package]{ergm.count}} is a set of extensions to
\R package \code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} to fit and simulate from exponential-family random 
graph models for networks whose edge weights are counts. For a list of
functions type \code{help(package='ergm')} and
\code{help(package='ergm.count')}

Mainly, it implements Poisson, binomial, geometric, and discrete uniform
dyadwise reference measures for valued ERGMs (\link[=ergm-references]{documented here}), and provides some
count-specific change statistics (\link[=ergm-terms]{documented here}).

For a complete list of the functions, use \code{library(help="ergm")} and \code{library(help="ergm.count")} 
or read the rest of the manual. 

When publishing results obtained using this package, please cite the
original authors as described in \code{citation(package="ergm.count")}.

All programs derived from this package must cite it.

\details{
This package contains functions specific to using \code{\link{ergm}} to
model networks whose dyad values are counts. Examples include counts of
conversations, messages, and other interactions.

In particular, this package implements the Poisson, geometric, binomial,
and discrete uniform reference measures (documented in \code{\link{ergm-references}}) for
use by \code{\link{ergm}} and \code{\link{simulate.ergm}} to fit models
from this family, as well as statistics specific to modeling counts,
such as the \code{\link{CMP}} for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution.

For detailed information on how to download and install the software,
go to the Statnet project website:

A tutorial, support newsgroup, references and links to further resources are provided there.
